    "The two most popular variations of the try statement in Python are:\n",
    "1. Basic try-except Block:\n",
    "- Description: This is the simplest form of the try statement, where we have a try block followed by one or more except blocks. The code inside the try block is executed, and if any exception occurs, it is caught by the corresponding except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException as e:\n",
    "    # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "except AnotherException as e:\n",
    "    # Handle another specific exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handle any other exception\n",
    "\n",
    "2. try-except-else Block:\n",
    "- Description: This variation includes an else block that contains code to be executed if no exception occurs in the try block. This can be useful when we want to distinguish between the code that might raise an exception and the code that should only run when no exception is encountered.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException as e:\n",
    "    # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "except AnotherException as e:\n",
    "    # Handle another specific exception\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handle any other exception\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Code to be executed if no exception occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "These variations allow us to customize the way our program handles exceptions. The basic try-except block is suitable for capturing and handling specific exceptions, while the try-except-else block provides an additional section for code that should only run when no exceptions are encountered. Both variations contribute to writing more robust and fault-tolerant code by providing mechanisms for handling unexpected situations."

    "The raise statement in Python is used to deliberately raise an exception during the execution of a program. It allows us to interrupt the normal flow of the program and signal that a specific exceptional condition has occurred. The primary purpose of the raise statement is to handle exceptional situations in a controlled manner and to provide a way to propagate errors or custom exceptions.\n",

    "1. Raising a Built-in Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",

    "    print(f\"Exception caught: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the raise statement is used to raise a ValueError exception with a custom error message when attempting to divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Raising a Custom Exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    # Some condition that triggers a custom exception\n",

    "    my_function()\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Custom exception caught: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a custom exception (CustomError) is defined and raised using the raise statement within the my_function function.\n",
    "The raise statement is a powerful tool for explicitly signaling errors or exceptional conditions in our code. It is commonly used in situations where predefined exceptions don't fully capture the nature of a problem, or when we want to create custom exceptions to represent specific error scenarios in our application."

    "The assert statement in Python is used for debugging and testing purposes. It checks if a given expression is True and, if not, raises an AssertionError exception with an optional error message. The primary purpose of assert is to help identify programming errors during development by verifying that certain conditions are met.\n",

    "assert expression[, \"Optional error message\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- expression: The boolean expression that is expected to be True. If the expression evaluates to False, an AssertionError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Optional error message\" (Optional): An optional string that provides additional information about the assertion. It is displayed in the error message if the assertion fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "assert x > 0, \"Value of x must be positive\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the assert statement checks whether the value of x is greater than 0. If the condition is False, the AssertionError is raised with the specified error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assert statement is similar to the if statement, but it is specifically designed for situations where certain conditions must be met for the program to function correctly. It is used during development and testing and is typically disabled in production for performance reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The assert statement is similar to an if statement in its syntax and behavior, but there is a fundamental difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "* assert vs. if:\n",
    "- The assert statement is intended for debugging and testing, and it is typically used to check invariants that should always be true in a correct program. If an assert statement fails, it indicates a bug or an unexpected condition in the code.\n",
    "- The if statement is used for conditional execution of code based on runtime conditions. It allows for more general control flow in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that using assert for runtime checks in production code is generally discouraged because assertions can be disabled globally with the -O (optimize) command-line switch, and they may introduce security risks or unexpected behavior if relied upon in critical code paths."

The as keyword within the with statement is used to bind the resource to a variable, making it accessible within the code block.\n",
