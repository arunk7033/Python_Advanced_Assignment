    "Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can have more than one immediate ancestor. This allows a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
    "For example, consider three classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. With multiple inheritance, a new class, let's call it Class D, can inherit from both Class B and Class C simultaneously. As a result, Class D would have access to the attributes and methods of both Class B and Class C.\n",
    "While multiple inheritance provides flexibility in code organization and reuse, it can also lead to complications such as the diamond problem. The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. Resolving conflicts in method names and data members from the common ancestor can be challenging in such cases. Some programming languages, like Python, provide mechanisms to address these conflicts, while others, like Java, avoid the issue altogether by not supporting multiple inheritance."

    "Delegation is a programming concept where one object passes on a task to another object to perform. Instead of a class handling a particular responsibility or behavior itself, it delegates that responsibility to another class or object. This is often used to achieve code reuse, modularity, and maintainability in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "In delegation, a class doesn't inherit the behavior of another class but instead holds a reference to it and forwards certain operations to it. This allows for a more flexible and dynamic relationship between objects. The object that delegates retains control over its overall behavior but can rely on other objects to handle specific tasks.\n",

    "Delegation is a powerful concept as it allows for a more modular and maintainable code structure by promoting loose coupling between objects. It is commonly used in various design patterns, such as the decorator pattern and strategy pattern."

    "Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where a class is composed of objects of other classes, rather than inheriting from them. In composition, the relationships between classes are based on having one class contain another class as a part. This is in contrast to inheritance, where classes are related through an \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "The main idea behind composition is to create complex objects by combining simpler ones. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and flexibility. The composed class doesn't inherit the implementation details of the classes it contains but rather uses their functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.engine = Engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car started\")\n",
    "        self.engine.start()\n",
    "\n",

    "my_car = Car()\n",
    "my_car.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the Car class has a composition relationship with the Engine class. The Car class contains an instance of the Engine class, and it delegates the start operation to the Engine object.\n",
    "Composition is often preferred over inheritance in many situations because it can lead to a more flexible and modular code structure. With composition, we can easily change the behavior of a class by altering the objects it contains or by adding new components without modifying the existing code. It also helps avoid some of the issues associated with multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem."

    "In object-oriented programming, a bound method refers to a method associated with an instance of a class. When a method is invoked on an instance, it is considered a bound method because it is bound to that specific instance. The instance on which the method is called is implicitly passed as the first parameter (usually named self in Python) to the method.\n",

    "In Python, pseudoprivate attributes, often denoted by double underscores before the attribute name (e.g., __attribute), are used to simulate private attributes or name mangling. While Python doesn't have true \"private\" members like some other object-oriented languages (e.g., Java), it does have a mechanism to make it harder to accidentally override attributes in subclasses.\n",
    "The primary purposes of pseudoprivate attributes are:\n",
    "1. Name Mangling: When a name is prefixed with double underscores (e.g., __attribute), Python performs name mangling by adding a prefix based on the class name. This helps to avoid naming conflicts between attributes in different classes.\n",

    "The actual name of the attribute becomes _MyClass__attribute in the above example, making it less likely to clash with attributes in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation: Although not true encapsulation, pseudoprivate attributes provide a degree of encapsulation by making it less likely for subclasses or external code to accidentally interfere with or override attributes defined in a class.\n",
    "It's important to note that the use of pseudoprivate attributes is more of a convention and a way to reduce accidental name clashes rather than a strict security measure. In Python, it is still possible to access pseudoprivate attributes from outside the class, but it is discouraged as it goes against the principle of encapsulation.\n",

    "obj._MyClass__attribute = 99  # Modifying pseudoprivate attribute (discouraged)\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers are expected to follow conventions and respect the privacy of attributes in order to maintain a clean and reliable codebase. If an attribute truly needs to be private, the convention is to use a single leading underscore (e.g., _attribute) to indicate that it should be treated as a non-public part of the API and not be accessed directly by external code."
