    "The two operator overloading methods that manage printing in Python are __str__ and __repr__. These methods define how instances of a class should be represented as strings when printed or converted to strings using the str() and repr() functions. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts:\n",
    "1. __str__ Method:\n",

    "2. __repr__ Method:\n",

    "In summary, __str__ is used for creating a human-readable string representation, while __repr__ is used for creating an unambiguous and often more detailed string representation, especially for debugging purposes. Both methods are optional, but if __repr__ is not defined and __str__ is, the latter is used as a fallback for cases where a detailed representation is needed."
