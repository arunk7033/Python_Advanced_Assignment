    "An abstract superclass, often simply referred to as an abstract class, is a class in object-oriented programming (OOP) that cannot be instantiated on its own. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes (subclasses) that can be instantiated. Abstract classes are designed to be subclassed, and they typically define abstract methods that must be implemented by their subclasses.\n",
    "Key characteristics of an abstract superclass include:\n",
    "1. Cannot be Instantiated:\n",
    "- Objects cannot be created directly from an abstract class. It exists to be inherited by other classes.\n",
    "2. May Contain Abstract Methods:\n",
    "- Abstract classes often include abstract methods, which are methods that are declared in the abstract class but have no implementation. Subclasses must provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",
    "3. May Contain Concrete Methods:\n",
    "- Abstract classes can also include concrete (implemented) methods. These methods provide common functionality that can be shared among the subclasses.\n",
    "4. Provides a Common Interface:\n",
    "- Abstract classes define a common interface for all their subclasses. This can include a combination of abstract and concrete methods that represent the expected behavior of the subclasses.\n",

The Circle and Rectangle classes are concrete subclasses that inherit from Shape and provide implementations for the abstract methods.

    "In Python, when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it is used to create a class variable. A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined at the class level, outside of any method, and is typically used to store data that is common to all instances of the class.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming, when a class inherits from another class, the subclass may need to call the superclass's __init__ method to ensure that the initialization code defined in the superclass is executed. The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created. It is commonly used for initializing attributes and performing other setup tasks.\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why a subclass needs to manually call a superclass's __init__ method:\n",
    "1. Inheritance of Initialization Logic:\n",
    "- The superclass's __init__ method typically contains important initialization logic, setting up attributes, and performing necessary setup tasks. If the subclass does not call the superclass's __init__, this initialization logic may be skipped, leading to incomplete or incorrect initialization of the object.\n",
    "2. Passing Arguments to the Superclass:\n",
    "- If the superclass's __init__ method expects certain arguments, the subclass needs to provide those arguments when calling the superclass's __init__. This ensures that the superclass can properly initialize its own state.\n",
    "3. Avoiding Code Duplication:\n",
    "- By calling the superclass's __init__ method, the subclass can reuse the initialization code defined in the superclass, avoiding code duplication. This follows the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), promoting code maintainability and reducing the risk of introducing errors.\n",
    "4. Maintaining a Consistent Object State:\n",
    "- Calling the superclass's __init__ method helps ensure that the object is in a consistent state after initialization. This is particularly important when dealing with complex class hierarchies where each class contributes to the overall state of the object.\n",

    "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Generic animal sound\n",
    "Bark, bark!\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how the Dog class retains and augments the functionality of the make_sound method from the Animal class.\n",
